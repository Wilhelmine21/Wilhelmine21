## This project is about my research.
* **GUI_ALL.exe** is for *Windows*.
* **GUI_ALL** works on *Linux*, but the archive is too big, I put it on my google drive --- [link](https://drive.google.com/).
* Demo video --- [link](https://youtu.be/kXfVsiijhno)

## My project is divided into 3 parts to work.
1. AN Codes
	* This project is used to generate an AN code decoder for 4 error models(verilog files) and use [iVerilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/) and [GTKwave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/) for functional verification.
2. ANRCAM
	* This project is used to divide the **activation function** into sets of line segments, using the shift method (instead of multiplication) to complete this formula.
3. EDA
	* This project is used for automated layout and drc, lvs verification.
	* It needs to work on linux.
	* Additional file required. --- [link](https://drive.google.com/)
